## Description
CSCIE-15 Second Project - xkcd-style password generator.
Features implemented:
1. Variable number of words in passphrase (required)
2. Optional number in passphrase (required)
3. Optional symbol in passphrase (required)
4. Choice of word delimiters (optional)
I did not scrape/generate a list of words and
used a static list to demonstrate the functionality.
